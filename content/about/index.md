Hello! My name is TH Huang; I am a Computer Science enthusiast.

### Research

Currently, I am pursuing a Master of Science degree in Computer Science at Northwestern University. With a deep interest in optimizing and parallelizing compilers, my passion lies in understanding the abstractions used within compilers and leveraging them to achieve broader optimization potential.

### Work

Before my Master’s, I gained over four years of experience building successful production systems, including B2B/B2C products, web/mobile applications, and distributed/parallel systems. As a backend developer, I have a strong background in designing and implementing large-scale services, with expertise in Go and other modern programming languages.

### Collaboration

I am excited about the potential of technology and look forward to collaborating with other talented professionals to push the boundaries of what’s possible.
